### Introduction

This project is a search engine for movies made with the forntend architecture of *Adevinta* (**react, ddd, es6, webpack, sui**). It has been made with the objective of learning a new frontend architecture and also to use it as a technical interview while approaching the scenario of a real life *Adevinta* project.
