# Pet Project Adevinta: Movie Search Engine by MartÃ­ Malek

### Introduction

This project is a search engine for movies made with the frontend architecture of *Adevinta* (**react, ddd, es6, webpack, sui...**). It has been made with the objective of learning a new frontend architecture and also to use it as a technical interview while approaching the scenario of a real life *Adevinta* project.

### About the project

The project uses the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com), which gives you a list of movies and their detailed information.

#### The project is based on the Adevinta web convergence tools and conventions:

- [sui-ssr](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui/tree/master/packages/sui-ssr)
- [sui-studio](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui/tree/master/packages/sui-studio)
- [sui-domain](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui/tree/master/packages/sui-domain)

#### Project Structure:

**Studio (components):** [frontend-mv--uilib-components](https://github.com/martimalek/Pet-Project-Adevinta/tree/master/2-frontend-mv--uilib-components)

**Domain (business logic):** [frontend-mv--lib-movies](https://github.com/martimalek/Pet-Project-Adevinta/tree/master/3-frontend-mv--lib-movies)

**Web server:** [frontend-mv--web-app](https://github.com/martimalek/Pet-Project-Adevinta/tree/master/4-frontend-mv--web-app)

### Technical Issues:

While doing this project I've come across multiple compatibility issues between *Adevinta*'s frontend architecture and *Windows OS*. There are a few of these that can be temporarilly overcome and I want to share the patches that I've found to resolve them.

- The first problem that I've found appears when trying to start the sui-studio:

    Basically you create your own studio with the following command

    ```sh
    > npx @s-ui/studio-create <your-studio-name>
    ```

    This works as expected, it creates the studio correctly, the problem comes when you try starting it:

    ```sh
    > npm run start
    ```

    Here is when it crashes:
    <pre><code>
    ./app.js 6:16
    Module parse failed: Unexpected token (6:16)
    You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
    | import Root from './components/root'
    |
    > reactDOM.render(<Root />, document.getElementById('root'))
    |
    </code></pre>

    To fix this you have to change the regExp which is in line 11 of \<your-studio-name>\/node_modules/@s-ui/bundler/webpack.config.dev.js

    Basically you can either comment it (make sure that you also comment the places where it is used -> lines 71, 75) or change it to a silly regExp like 'ab+c' or whatever you come up with.

    When you make this changes and save your files you'll be able to start your studio without issues.

- The next problem arrives when creating a component:

    Every time you create a component an error will throw, don't panic, the component is actually being created, but to use it without running into problems you'll have to go to it's folder (not the parent one) and install it's dependencies manually with:

    ```sh
    > npm install
    ```

    As easy as that. Now your component works. Note that if you are using the *Adevinta*'s linter the console will tell you to lint a couple files. Just go to the path that shows in the console and lint them to keep going.

- There are some sui commands that don't work and I have not yet figured out patches for them:

    ```sh
    > npm run co
    ```

    This basically helps you commit your work with the syntax of sui, it is specially useful in your sui-studio because it's changelog will be dynamically created. When you try this in *Windows OS* it may or may not work, I don't quite see the pattern yet. When not working it doesn't throw any error, just does nothing. In this case you'll have to commit normally `git commit -m "<message>"` to be able to save your progress, I personally recommend using the syntax and nomenclature of sui because it will have the same effect as running the script and it's semantically great, the issue is that you'll have to manually type it. On the other hand when it "works" it basically makes the commit successfully but it stays loading forever, you'll have to manually quit the process with `Ctrl + C`.

    ```sh
    > npm run release
    ```

    This command is used in *sui-studio* to make the release of your studio, I don't know why it doesn't work but it may have something to do with the patch for the creation of components.

> Note: Because of the above issues the components that you create with *sui-studio* cannot be uploaded to npm. To use them in your project you have to import them locally (using their relative path, like a regular react component import). Also be aware that I am a *newbie* when it comes to developing and this are all temporary solutions which should be used only if you are in real need of *sui-tools*, I'm absolutely positive that there are ways to completely fix the above issues but I haven't found them yet.
